# Module 2 Challenge : Lernantino/D0KD0

## Description
This is a second project to build a portfolio for myself. Example page image was given without code - which made me to start from a scratch. <br>
My portfolio page is looking like the example design but I replaced the contents with my personal information. <br>
Images used in this page are all from a free-soured website.
